The rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive layout maximized interior space within the minimal footprint, with a 599cc three-cylinder turbocharged engine initially producing 45 or 55 horsepower, later expanded to a 698cc version with up to 61 horsepower. Transmission was provided by a six-speed automated manual, which was notoriously jerky in early models but improved with successive updates. Available in closed coupé or semi-convertible 'cabrio' body styles, the fortwo offered surprisingly practical features including interchangeable body panels, a split tailgate, and a relatively spacious interior for two occupants despite the car's tiny exterior dimensions. Safety was addressed through the robust Tridion cell, crumple zones, and standard ABS, though early models received mixed crash test results. A facelift in 2003 brought improved quality, refined transmission operation, and additional features. While initially met with skepticism and frequently the subject of jokes, the first-generation fortwo successfully established itself as a pioneering urban vehicle particularly suited to congested European cities with limited parking, eventually selling over 770,000 units worldwide and spawning a new category of ultra-compact urban cars.","endYear":2007,"name":"First Generation (W450)","startYear":1998},{"description":"The second-generation smart fortwo maintained the revolutionary concept of its predecessor while addressing many of its shortcomings. Still built around a visible Tridion safety cell, the new fortwo grew slightly to 2.69 meters in length, improving crash protection and ride quality without compromising its city-friendly dimensions. The design evolved with more mature styling and improved aerodynamics while maintaining the distinctive smart aesthetic. Powertrain options expanded to include naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions of a 1.0-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine with power outputs ranging from 61 to 102 horsepower (in the Brabus performance version), along with a 0.8-liter diesel in some markets. The problematic transmission from the first generation was replaced with an improved five-speed automated manual, though shifts remained less refined than conventional automatics. The model range again included coupé and cabrio body styles, with the cabrio featuring a power-operated canvas roof that could be opened partially or fully. Interior quality improved significantly with better materials and more sophisticated design, while safety enhancements included standard ESP electronic stability control across the range. For the first time, a fully electric version (ED - Electric Drive) was offered in limited markets beginning in 2009, with a second-generation ED arriving in 2012 featuring improved range and performance. Special editions like the 'Passion,' 'BRABUS,' and 'Edition Limited Three' offered unique styling and equipment combinations. The second-generation fortwo expanded into new markets including the United States, where it offered the highest fuel economy of any gasoline-powered vehicle at the time, though its specialized nature limited appeal in regions where parking and congestion were less problematic than in European urban centers.","endYear":2014,"name":"Second Generation (W451)","startYear":2007},{"description":"The third-generation smart fortwo represented the most comprehensive redesign in the model's history, now developed as a joint project with Renault (which used the same platform for its Twingo). While maintaining the iconic proportions and Tridion safety cell, the new fortwo grew marginally to 2.7 meters in length but featured significantly improved engineering, notably a wider track that enhanced both stability and interior space. The distinctive rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout continued, but with all-new powertrains: a 1.0-liter naturally aspirated three-cylinder producing 71 horsepower or a 0.9-liter turbocharged three-cylinder with 90 horsepower. Most significantly, the much-criticized automated manual transmission was replaced with either a five-speed manual or a much smoother dual-clutch automatic (twinamic). The turning circle was further reduced to just 6.95 meters curb-to-curb, making it unrivaled for urban maneuverability. Available again in coupé and cabrio body styles, the third-generation fortwo featured more modern styling with a more prominent front grille, larger headlights, and a more substantial appearance despite its tiny dimensions. The interior saw major improvements with higher quality materials, a more contemporary design, and improved technology including a touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone integration. Safety systems expanded to include Crosswind Assist as standard, with forward collision warning and lane-keeping assist available as options. The electric version, now simply called the smart EQ fortwo, became increasingly important in the model's lineup, featuring an 80 horsepower electric motor and a 17.6 kWh battery providing approximately 100 miles of range. This generation introduced a new level of sophistication to the fortwo formula, making it a more viable everyday car while maintaining its unique positioning as the ultimate urban mobility solution.","endYear":2019,"name":"Third Generation (C453)","startYear":2014},{"description":"In 2019, smart announced a fundamental shift in strategy, transitioning to become an exclusively electric brand globally. As a result, from 2020 onward, the smart fortwo was available solely as the all-electric EQ fortwo, based on the third-generation platform but with combustion engines eliminated from the lineup entirely. The EQ fortwo maintained the distinctive styling and proportions of the standard third-generation model, with electric-specific details like a blanked-off grille and unique wheel designs. Powered by an 82 horsepower (60 kW) electric motor driving the rear wheels and a 17.6 kWh lithium-ion battery, the EQ fortwo offered approximately 80-100 miles of real-world range—modest by emerging electric vehicle standards but adequate for its focused urban use case. Charging capabilities included up to 22 kW AC through an onboard charger, allowing for a 10-80% charge in under 40 minutes at appropriate charging stations. Available in both coupé and cabrio body styles, the EQ fortwo featured enhanced connected services through a smartphone app allowing remote monitoring and control of charging, climate pre-conditioning, and vehicle status. Special editions included the Edition Bluedawn with distinctive cosmetic upgrades in gray and blue color schemes. As the brand prepared for a complete reinvention under majority ownership by Geely (with Mercedes-Benz retaining a 50% stake), the EQ fortwo represented the final evolution of the original smart concept first introduced in 1998. Production for European markets ended in 2023, with the smart brand subsequently pivoting to larger, Geely-developed electric vehicles targeting a broader market, though the fortwo's influence on urban mobility and microcar design remains significant.","endYear":2023,"name":"Electric Generation (EQ fortwo)","startYear":2020}]}
