Launched in 1979, the W460 featured austere and utilitarian design with angular, boxy styling that would become iconic. Built on a rugged body-on-frame construction with solid axles front and rear, it offered exceptional off-road capability through its three locking differentials - a rare feature that distinguished it from other passenger vehicles. The W460 was available in multiple body configurations including two-door and four-door versions, convertibles, panel vans, and pickup trucks, with both short (2,400mm) and long (2,850mm) wheelbase options. Engine choices ranged from economical diesels like the 240 GD and 300 GD to gasoline engines including the 230 G, 280 GE, and later fuel-injected variants. The interior was spartan and functional, focusing on durability over luxury. Major updates in 1981 introduced automatic transmission and air conditioning options, while 1982 brought fuel injection with the 230 GE. By 1986, over 50,000 units had been produced. A facelift in 1990 improved refinement, but the W460 remained fundamentally a working vehicle rather than a luxury SUV. Production ended in 1991 as it transitioned to the more refined W463 generation, establishing the G-Class foundation that would endure for decades.","endYear":1991,"name":"First Generation (W460)","startYear":1979},{"description":"The W461 generation served as the utilitarian workhorse continuation of the original G-Class philosophy, running parallel to the more luxurious W463 from 1992 to 2022. Built on essentially the same chassis as the W460 but incorporating powertrain improvements from the W463, the W461 was specifically designed for military, government agencies, and commercial users who needed the G-Class's legendary capability without luxury appointments. Featuring a 24-volt electrical system for military compatibility, the W461 retained the solid front and rear axles with three locking differentials that made the G-Class unparalleled in off-road situations. During the 1990s, it was powered by a 2.3-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine and 2.9-liter five-cylinder diesel engine. From 2001, it received modern turbodiesel engines including the 2.7-liter five-cylinder in the G 270 CDI Worker and later the 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel in the G 280 CDI Worker. Limited civilian editions were occasionally offered, including the G 280 CDI EDITION.30 PUR in 2009 celebrating the G-Class's 30th anniversary, and the G 300 CDI Professional from 2010-2019, available in various body configurations from panel vans to pickup trucks. These featured more basic interiors with vinyl surfaces, rubber floor coverings, and manually operated controls, emphasizing function over form. The W461 proved so successful in military applications that it was used by armed forces worldwide, earning nicknames like 'Wolf' in German service.

This generation moved the G-Class upmarket to compete with vehicles like the Range Rover, featuring significantly improved interior appointments with wood trim, leather upholstery, and more sophisticated amenities while retaining the iconic boxy exterior design. The W463 introduced full-time four-wheel drive with electrically locking differentials and ABS as standard equipment. Initially offering familiar engines from the W460, the range expanded dramatically over its long production run to include everything from four-cylinder to twelve-cylinder engines, naturally aspirated to supercharged and twin-turbo configurations. Key updates included the 1997 revision with V6 engines replacing inline units, the 2002 U.S. market launch, and the 2007 major refresh with new interior, HID headlamps, and updated technology. The W463 spawned numerous special editions and variants, including the legendary 500 GE V8 (1993), G 500 Classic Special-Edition (1999), and exotic models like the G 63 AMG 6×6 (2013-2015) and Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet (2017). AMG variants became increasingly important, starting with the G 55 AMG in 2002 and evolving through supercharged and twin-turbo V8 and V12 engines producing up to 621 horsepower.

Launched in January 2018, this generation grew significantly in dimensions - 121mm wider, 53mm longer, with 6mm more ground clearance - primarily to meet new EU pedestrian safety regulations while improving interior space and driving dynamics. Despite retaining the W463 chassis designation, only three parts carried over from the previous generation: headlamp washers, door handles, and spare wheel cover. The most significant mechanical change was switching from a recirculating ball steering system to variable-ratio rack-and-pinion with electric power assistance, necessitating a move from solid front axle to independent front suspension while maintaining the solid rear axle and three locking differentials. This enabled modern safety features like active lane-keeping assist and collision avoidance systems. Interior technology leaped forward with dual 12-inch displays, smartphone integration, and 64-color ambient lighting, while build quality reached new heights with tighter panel gaps and improved materials. The initial lineup included the G 500/G 550 with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 producing 416 horsepower and the Mercedes-AMG G 63 with 577 horsepower. Diesel variants followed with the G 350 d and G 400 d using clean 2.9-liter inline-six engines. Special editions included the Stronger Than Time anniversary models and the exclusive G manufaktur customization program. Notable variants included the return of the G 63 4×4² in 2022 and the Final Edition G 500 V8 in 2023, marking the end of V8 power in the non-AMG model.

The Mercedes-AMG G 63 continues with the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8, now also featuring mild-hybrid assistance. The diesel option evolves to the G 450 d with an upgraded 3.0-liter inline-six turbodiesel producing 362 horsepower, also with 48-volt hybrid support. Most significantly, April 2024 saw the introduction of the G 580 with EQ Technology, the first fully electric G-Class featuring four independent electric motors producing 579 horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque, capable of 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds. The electric variant maintains true off-road capability with the signature three locking differentials through innovative engineering, though it faces challenges with its 6,801-pound weight, limited 239-mile EPA range, and high price point compared to ICE variants.

The name 'BRZ' stands for Boxer engine, Rear-wheel drive, and Zenith. Built on a unique platform with the engine placed low and far back in the chassis to achieve an exceptionally low center of gravity and near-perfect weight distribution, the BRZ featured Subaru's naturally aspirated 2.0-liter FA20 flat-four 'boxer' engine with Toyota's D-4S direct and port injection system, producing 200 horsepower and 151 lb-ft of torque.

Developed as a joint venture between Swatch and Mercedes-Benz (later fully acquired by Daimler-Benz), the fortwo featured a distinctive two-tone color scheme with a visible 'Tridion' safety cell surrounding the passenger compartment. The rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive layout maximized interior space within the minimal footprint, with a 599cc three-cylinder turbocharged engine initially producing 45 or 55 horsepower, later expanded to a 698cc version with up to 61 horsepower. Transmission was provided by a six-speed automated manual, which was notoriously jerky in early models but improved with successive updates. Available in closed coupé or semi-convertible 'cabrio' body styles, the fortwo offered surprisingly practical features including interchangeable body panels, a split tailgate, and a relatively spacious interior for two occupants despite the car's tiny exterior dimensions. Safety was addressed through the robust Tridion cell, crumple zones, and standard ABS, though early models received mixed crash test results. A facelift in 2002 brought improved quality, refined transmission operation, and additional features. While initially met with skepticism and frequently the subject of jokes, the first-generation fortwo successfully established itself as a pioneering urban vehicle particularly suited to congested European cities with limited parking, eventually selling over 770,000 units worldwide and spawning a new category of ultra-compact urban cars.","endYear":2007,"name":"First Generation (W450)","startYear":1998},{"description":"The second-generation smart fortwo maintained the revolutionary concept of its predecessor while addressing many of its shortcomings.

The model range again included coupé and cabrio body styles, with the cabrio featuring a power-operated canvas roof that could be opened partially or fully. Interior quality improved significantly with better materials and more sophisticated design, while safety enhancements included standard ESP electronic stability control across the range. For the first time, a fully electric version (ED - Electric Drive) was offered in limited markets beginning in 2009, with a second-generation ED arriving in 2012 featuring improved range and performance. Special editions like the 'Passion,' 'BRABUS,' and 'Edition Limited Three' offered unique styling and equipment combinations.
