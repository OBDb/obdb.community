# OBDb Explorer: Migration from Material UI to Tailwind CSS

## Overview

This document outlines the migration of the OBDb Explorer application from Material UI to Tailwind CSS. The goal was to increase information density and create a more compact UI while maintaining functionality.

## Key Changes

### Dependencies
- Removed Material UI dependencies:
  - `@emotion/react`
  - `@emotion/styled`
  - `@mui/icons-material`
  - `@mui/material`
- Added Tailwind CSS dependencies:
  - `tailwindcss`
  - `autoprefixer`
  - `postcss`
- Added Headless UI for accessible components:
  - `@headlessui/react`
  - `@heroicons/react` (for icons)

### Configuration
- Added Tailwind configuration files:
  - `tailwind.config.js` - Core configuration with custom colors matching previous theme
  - `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS setup for Tailwind
- Added Tailwind directives to `index.css` with custom component classes

### UI Components
- **Navbar**: Redesigned to be more compact with responsive mobile menu
- **Footer**: Simplified for a cleaner look
- **Tables**: Designed for higher information density with smaller text and padding
- **Cards**: Reduced whitespace and padding for more efficient use of space
- **Pagination**: Rebuilt with smaller controls
- **Search & Filters**: Consolidated with more compact layout

### Information Density Improvements
- **Font Sizes**: Reduced from Material UI's default sizes
  - Primary content: 0.875rem (14px) → 0.75rem (12px)
  - Secondary content: 1rem (16px) → 0.875rem (14px)
- **Padding & Spacing**: Significantly reduced
  - Table cells: 16px → 8px or less
  - Card padding: 24px → 16px
  - Vertical spacing between elements: reduced by ~30%
- **Table Density**:
  - Row height reduced by ~40%
  - Added hover states for better row distinction
  - Reduced height of header rows
- **Visual Hierarchy**:
  - Used font weight instead of font size when possible
  - Applied color sparingly for better scanning
  - More compact badges and chips

### Page-Specific Improvements

#### Vehicles Page
